# Informal website of CREDS Theme 2

To go onto the main website after testing.

Website was created as follows

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
curl -u robinlovelace https://api.github.com/orgs/creds2/repos -d '{"name":"creds2.github.io", "description":"CREDS Website", "private": false, "has_issues": true, "has_projects": true, "has_wiki":false }'
curl -u robinlovelace https://api.github.com/orgs/creds2/repos -d '{"name":"website", "description":"CREDS Website source code", "private": false, "has_issues": true, "has_projects": true, "has_wiki":false }'
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:creds2/website
git status
git add -A
git commit -am 'Initialise website repo'
git push --set-upstream master
git push origin master
```

Then in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
dir.create("site_temp")
blogdown::new_site(dir = "site_temp")
list.files("site_temp/")
system("mv -v site_temp/* .")
```

And to serve:

```{r}
blogdown::build_site()
blogdown::serve_site()
```

The goal of website is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
